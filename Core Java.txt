Java
------
In Java every variable and expression has some type. (Java is Strongly Typed).
Each every data type is clearly defined. every assignment should be checked 
by compiler for type comparability. 
Java is not consider as pure object oriented programing language because 
several oops features not satisfied by java like operator overloading and 
multiple inheritance etc. more over we depending on primitive data type non objects.
Main Method:
------------
public  class Test {
    final static synchronized strictfp public void main(String... x){
          System.out.print("Valid Main");
    }
}
Checked Exceptions and Unchecked Exceptions:
--------------------------------------------
1)Checked exceptions
  Exception checked by compiler is Checked exceptions (Ex: FileNotFountException,IOException)
  must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using throws keyword.
1)Unchecked exceptions
  Unchecked are the exceptions that are not checked at compiled time.(Ex:ArithmeticException ,NullPointerException)
  So it is not forced by the compiler to either handle or specify the exception.
  
"== operator" and "equals() method" 
-----------------------------------
== operator is reference comparison or address comparison. equals() method is content comparison.

Various memory areas in JVM:
---------------------------
1)Method Area:
	Class Data(class level data and static variables)
2)Heap Area
	Object Data(all objects and instance variable)
3)Stack Area:
	local variable
	every thread will create one run time stack. each entry in stack called stack frame and
	the stack frame have three parts a)local variable array b) operand stack c) frame data
4)PC Register
	This for to hold address of current execution. 
5)Native Method Stack
	Every thread will create one run time stack for hold native method information.

Collection(I) 1.2v (Group of individual object in single entity)
-------------
1)List(I)1.2v (Duplicate will allowed and insert order will maintain)
  a)ArrayList(c)1.2v
  b)LinkedList(c)1.2v
  c)Vector(c) (legacy classes)
     1)Stack(c) (legacy classes)
2)Set(I)1.2v (Duplicate will not allowed but this not maintain insert order)
	a)HashSet(c)1.2v
		1)LinkedHashSet(c)1.4v
	b)SortedSet(I) 1.2v (Duplicate will not allowed but all object should be inserted according to some sorting order)
		1)NavigableSet(I)1.6v (,,several methods for navigation process)
			i)TreeSet(c)
3)Queue(I)(if u went collection prior to process)1.5v FIFO
	a)PriorityQueue(c)
	b)BlockingQueue(c)
		i)LinkedBlockingQueue(c)
		ii)PriorityBlockingQueue(c)

Map:(I) if u want group of objects as key value pairs (in map key not allowed duplicate but value can allow duplicate)
-----
1)HashMap(c)1.2v
	a)LinkedHashMap1.4v
2)WeakHashMap(c)1.2v
3)IdentityHashMap(c)1.4v
4)Hashtable(c)<---Dictionary(ac) ( both are legacy classes)
	a)properties(c) (legacy classes)
5)SortedMap(I)1.2v(the group of object as key value pairs according to some sorting order of keys)
	a)NavigableMap(I)1.6v
		i)TreeMap(c)1.2v (several utility methods for navigation process)
Sorting:
--------
1)Comparable(I) (Default Nature Sorting)
2)Comparator(I) (Customized Sorting)
Cursors:
--------
1)Enumeration
2)Iterator
3)ListIterator
Utility Classes:
---------------
1)Collections
2)Arrays

Has-A Relationship:
-------------------
1)Aggregation
2)Composition

Composition :
------------- 
Without exciting container object if the no chance of existing contain objects then container 
and contain object are strong associated and the the strong association is Composition.
Ex: University and their Department.
in Composition container obj holds directly contained object.
 
Aggregation 
------------
Without exciting container object if there is chance of existing contain objects then container
and contain object are weekly associated and the weekly association is Aggregation. 
Ex:Department and Professor.
in association container obj holds just reference of contained object.

Has-A  vs Is-A:
---------------
1)if u want total functionality of class automatically then if should go far Is-A Relationship.
2)if u want part of functionality then should for Has-A relationship

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method Signature:
-----------------
Method name and argument types only consider as a method signature in Java.
compiler will use method signature to resolve method calls.
Ex: public static int m1(int x) ==> m1(int).(Return type not part MS in Java)


Method Overloading
------------------
Two method are set to be overloaded if an only if both method same name but different argument is method overloading.
Ex:abs method (C language is not allow method overloading).
In overloading method revaluation always takes care by compiler based on reference type. 

1)Automatic promotion in overloading by resolving overloading methods if exact matched method not available then 
we won't get any compile time error immediately first is promote argument to the next level and check whether the matched method available or not
if matched method is available then it will consider and if matched method is not available then compile promote argument once again to the next level
if process will continue until all  promotion still if matched method not available then we get compile time error.
the following are all possible promotion in overloading:
char-->int-->long-->float-->double
byte-->short-->int-->long-->float-->double

while resolve over method compile all ways use prescient for child type argument then compare with parent argument.
Ex1: m1(String) and m1(Object) now calling m1(null) is will call the string method.
Ex2: m1(String) and m1(StringBuffer) now calling m1(null) is will get compile time error because string and stringBuffer are same level.(ambiguous) 
Ex3: m1(int,float) and m1(float,int) now calling m1(10,10) is will get compile time error because both method are valid. (ambiguous) 
                                     now calling m1(10.5,10.5) is will get compile time error because can't find symbol m1(float,float).
Ex4: m1(int){"int"} and m1(int...){"var args"} now calling m1() "var args"
											   now calling m1(10,20) "var args"
											   now calling m1(10) "int" because int is old version varargs is version.
	in general varargs  method is will get least priority.the no other method matched then only varargs will get the chance its is exactly same as default case inside switch.

Overriding
----------
what ever method parent has by default available to child through inheritance .if child class not satisfy parent class implementation then child is allowed to redefine based
based on requirement this process called overriding. Parent Method is call as overridden method and child method is call as overriding.
Rules for overriding: 
1)in overriding method name and argument must be same that is method signature must be same.
2)In overriding return type must be same but this rule applicable until 1.4 version only .but from 1.5 version onwards we can take co-variant return types.
  according to this child class method type need not be same as parent class method return type its child type also allowed.
  co-variant return type concept applicable only for object type not for primitive 
  parent return type --> child rt  ? Object---->String,SB,... :allowed; Number --- Integer,double.... :allowed ; String ---> Object :not allowed; Integer ---> int :not allowed;
3) parent class private methods not available to the child and hens overriding concept is not applicable for private methods. 
   based on requirement we can define exactly same private method in child class is valid but is not overriding. 
   we cant overriding parent class final methods in child classes. if we try to override we will get compile time error.
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
*In overriding method resolution always takes by jvm based on runtime object , and overriding is also consider as runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism or late binding.* 
MySQL Function vs Stored Procedure
----------------------------------
1)Function must return a value but in Stored Procedure it is optional. Even a procedure can return zero or n values.
2)Functions can have only input parameters for it whereas Procedures can have input or output parameters .
3)Functions can be called from Procedure whereas Procedures cannot be called from a Function.
4)Procedure allows SELECT as well as DML(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statement in it whereas Function allows only SELECT statement in it.
5)Exception can be handled by try-catch block in a Procedure whereas try-catch block cannot be used in a Function.
